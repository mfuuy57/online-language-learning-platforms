## FAQ

**How do online language tutoring platforms differ from apps like Duolingo?**

Tutoring platforms like italki and Preply connect learners with live teachers for real-time conversation practice and personalized instruction, while apps like Duolingo provide self-paced lessons through gamified exercises. Live tutoring addresses speaking and listening skills more effectively through human interaction, whereas apps excel at vocabulary building and grammar drills. Many learners use both approaches together, combining app-based daily practice with weekly tutoring sessions for comprehensive skill development.

**What should I look for when choosing a language teacher online?**

Key factors include the teacher's native language status, teaching qualifications, student reviews, lesson price, and availability. Most platforms offer trial lessons at discounted rates, allowing you to test teaching style compatibility before committing. Consider whether you prefer structured lessons with professional teachers or conversational practice with community tutors. Your learning goals—exam preparation, business communication, or casual conversation—should guide your teacher selection.

**Are language exchange apps effective for learning?**

Language exchange apps like Tandem and HelloTalk provide valuable free practice with native speakers but work best when combined with structured learning resources. The quality of feedback varies since exchange partners aren't professional teachers. Success depends heavily on finding committed, compatible language partners willing to consistently practice. These platforms excel at developing conversational skills and cultural understanding once you have foundational grammar and vocabulary.

The language learning landscape offers solutions for every learning style, budget, and schedule. For learners seeking personalized instruction with maximum teacher variety, [italki](https://italki.com/) provides access to thousands of tutors across 150+ languages with flexible pay-per-lesson pricing. Those preferring unlimited practice might consider BaseLang's flat-rate Spanish immersion , while budget-conscious learners can explore free language exchange through Tandem or HelloTalk before investing in paid tutoring. The key to success lies in consistent practice, regardless of which platform you choose.
